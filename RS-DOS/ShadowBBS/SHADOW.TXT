You have just purchased one of the most feature-filled and complete Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) available.  Some of it's many features include:ANSI Graphics Support      - ANSI can be added in messages28 Line 40/80 Columns      - Larger screen shows what the user                             is doing.  Also fully displays ANSI                             graphicsAutoMessage                - Brief message shown during logonBorderlines (Quotes)       - One-line "quotes" shown randomly                             at the menu promptCaller Log                 - Keeps a record of the last 20                             callers to the systemDiscussions                - One-liner message area in script                             form (great for stories)File Transfers             - Up/Download programs to/from the                             systemFull SysOp Utilities       - Update users without exiting BBSMessage Bases              - Up to 255 independently numbered                             message areas known as "rooms"Software Clock             - Set time limits for callersStatus Window              - Shows information about the callerSurveys                    - Voting boothUser Profiles              - Personal information about callers                             (which may be selectively censored)X/Y Modem                  - Up/download filesAnd much, much more        - ...whew!ôHardware Requirements--------------------- €¥Hardware Requirements€  ---------------------Shadow BBS will function with a minimum amount of hardware.  The following items are required:     €§o€   Tandy CoCo 3 with 128K memory     €§o€   1 Disk Drive     €§o€   Auto-Answer Modem (hooked to serial port)While not necessary to completely function, the following equipment is supported:     €§o€   Additional Disk Drives (or Ram Disks on a 512K CoCo)     €§o€   RS232 Pak (for speeds faster than 1200 baud)     €§o€   80 Column Monitor (to correctly see Ansi)You will notice that a basic system can run adequately on a 128K CoCo 3 with one disk drive and a modem hooked up through the serial (printer) port.  The only limitation to this is less space for system files and 1200 baud will be the fastest speed supported.ôBackground--------------------------- €¥Background€  --------------------------ã€§About the Programs€ Shadow BBS operates under the Sub-Etha Software MultiBasic package.  MultiBasic allows programs much larger than normal Basic memory to be created.  You do not need MultiBasic to run the BBS since we include a "run-time" version which allows the program to operate.  Please note that you will NOT be able to edit any of the BBS modules without the complete MultiBasic package.  (For those who are interested in customizing the program even further, a special discount on MultiBasic is being offered to Shadow BBS SysOps.  Call or write for details.)The BBS system itself is composed of numerous programs and data files.  The majority of the programs are by Terry Todd, but credit must be given to a few public domain/shareware utilities.The DFIX utility by Steve Bjork is included.  This allows the program to run in high speed mode at all times.  Also included are driver routines by Ken Johnston to handle modem communications, ANSI, and file transfers.These programs and routines are distributed with the permission from the authors.  Special thanks goes to both Ken and Steve for allowing us to distribute their routines!  (See "€¥Aknowledgements€ ")ã€§About the Manual€ This documentation assumes that you have a knowledge of basic terms associated with telecommunications and bulletin boards in general.ôSetting Up--------------------------- €¥Setting Up€  --------------------------€¥Note:€   Before attempting to run Shadow BBS, we recommend you make a Backup of your master disk and use that.  Refer to your Disk Basic manual if you are unsure on how to do this, or call our support line.ã€§Single Drive Users€ If you have only one disk drive, will need to create an "online disk".  This online disk will contain all the files necessary to run the BBS once it is installed.  Your backup of the master disk will become your "startup disk".  Get your master disk backup and a blank (formatted) diskette ready.Insert your master disk backup into Drive 0 and type:ãRUN"ONEDISK"The program will prompt you to swap between the BBS disk and the blank disk.  Be patient as it takes quite a few swaps to copy all of the files over to the new disk.  Once complete you will have a Startup disk (the copy of the BBS disk) and an Online disk (the new disk that was created).ã€§Multiple Drive Users€ If you have more than one disk drive, simply proceed to "€¥Loading Instructions€ ".  (You may later want to prepare a startup disk to give you more space for data files while running the BBS.)ôLoading Instructions--------------------- €¥Loading Instructions€  ----------------------€¥Note:€   These instructions are given to get your BBS up and running as quick as possible.  Details are given later in this manual on how to customize the system for a more personalized appearance.To boot Shadow BBS, insert the startup disk into Drive 0 and type:ãLOADM"BBS"The program will quickly load and the "OK" prompt will return.  To run Shadow BBS, type:ãEXECShadow BBS will then load and you will see the startup screen with a version, serial number, and copyright notice.  You will be asked if you wish to use 80 columns.  Select "Y"es or "No".  (Note:  If using 40 columns, you will not get the status window and ANSI graphics will not be displayed on your screen.)  The program then installs the rest of the necessary files for operation.  After a brief pause you will be prompted to insert the online disk.  If you are using one drive, remove the startup disk and insert your online disk.  If you have multiple drives, just make sure you have a blank disk in any drive(s) you plan to use for the BBS.  Press Enter and the main Shadow BBS screen will appear.  At this point the system is ready for you to logon locally (from the keyboard) or for someone to call remotely.€¥Note:€   If you have an RS232 Pak plugged in, the system will set itself up to use that instead of the serial (printer) port.  If the program does not recognize your RS232 Pak you may have to power down and try again.ôLogging On-------------------------- €¥Logging On€  ---------------------------ã€§Local (SysOp) Logon€ At the system standby screen, you may press Enter and perform a "local" logon. The system will respond just as if you called from a remote location by identifying itself and then prompting you to select your screen width. ã€§Remote (Modem) Logon€ Remote callers can dial in at 300, 1200, or 2400 baud.  (€¥Note:€   If you are using the serial port, 1200 baud is the highest speed supported.)  Starting at 1200 baud, the system will send a "Press Return" message to the caller.  If nothing is received after a few moments, the BBS will cycle through 2400 and 300 baud displaying the same message.  The user simply waits until the message is visible (meaning the BBS is at their baud rate) then presses Return.The system will then identify itself and prompt the user for their screen width.The system prompts you to enter your handle (name) or user number.  To register as a new user, press Enter.  If a name is entered, the system will search for that name in the userlog (no need to remember user numbers).  If not found the system will ask "Are you a new caller to the BBS? (Y/N):" then take you into the New User Registration area.ã€§New User Registration€ €¥Note:€   The first userlog entry will automatically become the SysOp and have SysOp access.  It is therefore recommended that you logon first and create this account.The system will locate a spot in the userlog then you will be prompted to give the name you want to use on the system and a password.  The system will then modify your password by adding two random letters to the end of it.  This is done to create a password that is easy to remember yet difficult for someone else to guess.  (€¥Note:€   The SysOp can later alter passwords as he/she chooses.)A verification check is then done to make sure you have written down the correct password.  Then will come a series of configuration questions which will set graphic protocol, default transfer protocol, screen width, mail check at logon, clear screen codes, and screen pause.  (€¥Note:€   These settings can later be changed.  See "€¥User Statistics€ ")After the userlog information is saved, a series of more personal questions will be asked.  These are stored in a special profile section which other users can examine.  After each question you have the option of censoring the information.  Censored information will be viewable only by the SysOp.After completing registration you then proceed with a normal logon.ã€§Registered User Logon€ After entering a correct name and password you will have the option of viewing the System News file if there is a new one.  The AutoMessage and any message from the Last Caller will be shown and, if selected, a Mail Check and/or Quickscan will then be done.  You will then be at the Main Menu.€¥Note:€   When the SysOp logs on, the BBS will ask "Enter into caller log?".  Selecting "Y"es will continue with a normal logon.  "N"o will take you directly to the Main Menu without updating the caller log, displaying logon messages, performing mail check or quickscan.€¥Before attempting to operate the system you must customize it for your hardware configuration!  The default setup included on the master disk is there to let you see what the system looks like, but it does not have enough room to be useful.  Please read through the Main Menu options then see "SysOp Menu". € ôThe Main Menu------------------------- €¥The Main Menu€  -------------------------Depending on your userlog settings, you will see either a 40 column or 80 column menu listing all of the functions available:     [A]utoMessage         - Displays the current AutoMessage                             then allows you to add a new one.                             (See "€¥AutoMessage€ ")     [B]ulletins           - Displays a list of text files which                             can be viewed.

(See "€¥User Statistics€ ")     [%] SysOp Menu        - This option should not be displayed                             on the menu.  It will allow you to                             correctly setup the system for your                             particular hardware.  (See "€¥SysOp                             Menu€ ")ôSysOp Menu-------------------------- €¥SysOp Menu€  ---------------------------From the Main Menu the SysOp can go into the special SysOp Menu by selecting "%". From this menu you can reset bulletin pointers, set date and time, setup default drive numbers, initialize the message bases, and create the discussions.€¥Note:€   To be familiar with how the system operates you should first read the sections on the Message Base and Discussions.€§ãSetup Default Drive Numbers€ First you must define which drive(s) will contain each system file:Text Files                 - Where all the text files are.User Information           - Profiles, userlog, and pointers.File Transfers             - Up/Downloads.Message Base               - All message base files.Discussions                - Discussion files.System Files               - Configuration, borderlines, room                             names, automessage, message from                             last caller, etc.ã€§Initialize Message Base€ This option is used to define the maximum length the message base can become. (Shadow BBS does not pre-allocate messages.  A message one-line long will only take up one line worth of message space.  This is a very efficient use of disk space.)Number of Rooms? (1-255):  - Enter the number of rooms you wish                             to have.Maximum Number of Granules - Enter how many granules of disk                             space you wish to allow the message                             text to use.Your message base will now be created on the previously defined drive.  You will have to go into the BBS and customize the room names.  (See "€§Editing Room Names€ " under "€¥SysOp Utilities€ ")ã€§Intialize Discussions€ Number of Discussions      - Enter the number of discussions                             you wish to have.Maximum # of Entries       - Total lines which each discussion                             can have.After this, the discussion files will be created on the previously defined drive.  You will have to go into the Discussions to change the discussion names.  (See "€§Changing Discussion Names€ " under "€¥Discussions€ ")ã€§Reset Bulletin Read Flag€ There is a flag in the userlog that shows whether or not the user has read the Bulletin file (displayed during login).  If you update this file, use this option to reset the flags so users will be told "There is a new system news file" when they call.ã€§Set Date and Time€ The system will ask you to enter the current date and time in the format of Month/Day/Year Hour:Minute:Second.  If the current time is correct, just press Enter and no change will be made.See the section entitled "€¥SysOp Utilities€ " for more information on how you can control and maintain the system.ôMessage Base------------------------ €¥The Message Base€  -----------------------ã€§Description€ Shadow BBS can provide up to 255 different message areas known as "rooms".  Each room has it's own name (ie, General Messages, CoCo Forem, Debate, etc.) and each has it's own numbering system.ôMoving Around the Message Baseã€§Moving Around€ There are several ways to move from one room to the next.  The easiest is by using the Left and Right arrow keys.  (Non-CoCo users should be told to use Tab/Backspace or Plus+/Minus-.)  This will move you to the next or previous room you have access to.  (€¥Note:€   If using a Hayes compatible modem, users should be aware of the fact that three "+" characters in a row cause the modem to go into command mode.)The next way is by using the [J]ump to Room command.  This command will prompt you to enter either the room number or name.  Typing in the first few matching characters of a room name also works.  For example, "Gen" would take you to a room called "General Messages", or "C" would take you to the first room it found that started with that letter.And for the really lazy ones out there, just type the room number at the Main Menu prompt.  The system will immediately respond with "Jump to Room #" and allow you to finish typing in the number.ôPosting Messagesã€§Posting Messages€ To write a public message, use the [P]ost a Message option.  It will place the message in the current room.You will be asked to enter who the message is to.  This could be a specific user or general addresses such as "All" or "CoCo Users".  Next the system will ask for a message subject.  This is the general topic the message will be about.(€¥Note:€   If the message being left is a private E-Mail letter, the system will verify that the adressee actually exists.)After answering these prompts, a line will be drawn showing you the maximum length a message line can be and you can enter your message text.  Message text will automatically "word wrap" so there is no need to press Enter after each line.Pressing slash ("/") at the ">" prompt will put you in "Command:" mode.  From this prompt you can do one of the following:     A/bort                - Quit and return to the Main Menu     B/egin over           - Clear message and start over     E/dit a line          - Edit (retype) a specific line     H/elp                 - List these options     L/ist                 - List message text     N/umbered list        - List with numbered lines     S/ave                 - Save messageAfter saving, you will be returned to the Main Menu.ôReading Messagesã€§Reading Messages€ To read a specific message in the current room, use the [R]ead Messages command.  You will be asked which message you would like to read.  Enter the number and that message will be displayed.  At the end of the message will be more options:     [A]gain               - List current message again     [B]ack Thru Chain     - If the message you are reading is                             a reply to a previous message, this                             option will take you back to that                             message.  You can continue "B"ack                             until you are at the first message                             posted in the chain.     [D]elete              - You will be allowed to delete the                             message if you were the one who                             posted it or if you are the SysOp.     [N]ext                - Continues reading with the next                             message.     [Q]uit                - Quits reading and exits back to                             the Main Menu.     [R]eply               - Allows you to post a Reply message.                             When you start entering text you                             will notice the first line has a                             "RE:" prompt (for REply).  You may                             use this to enter a sub-title for                             the message, or just backspace over                             it (or press Enter to delete it) if                             you have no sub-title.ôQuickscanã€§Quickscan€ The most convienient way to read all the new messages that have been posted is by using the [Q]uickscan feature.  This option will display all of the new messages in all marked rooms you have access to.  (See "€§Marking Rooms€ ")€¥Note:€   If you select "Q"uit while reading you will be asked if you wish to "Continue Quickscan? (Y/N):".  If you wish to stop reading entirely, select "N"o.  If you select "Y"es you will continue reading messages in the next available room.ôMarking Roomsã€§Marking Rooms€ To control which rooms included in your Quickscan, you may selectively mark them.  Do this by pressing the slash ("/") key from the Main Menu.  The prompt looks something like this:(General Messages) ==>       ... Typical marked room.Marked rooms are shown in parenthesis, and unmarked rooms are shown in reverse parenthesis:)General Messages( ==>       ... Same room, unmarked.Each time you press "/" the room will toggle between being marked and unmarked. Simply move through each room and mark (or unmark) the ones that interest you.ôDiscussions-------------------------- €¥Discussions€  --------------------------One of the most unique features of Shadow BBS is the Discussions.  This is an area of the system (accessible by the [D]iscussions command from the Main Menu) where users can participate in one-line messages.  Each discussion should have  it's own topic (ie, "Story", "One-Liners", etc.).Discussions operate almost identically to the message base.  Using the Left/Right arrow keys (or Plus+/Minus-) takes you from topic to topic.  The slash ("/") is used to mark and unmark discussion areas.  You can "Q"uickscan all new discussion entries, "P"ost a new one, or "R"ead selected entries. As usual, "X" will return you to the Main Menu.When you [P]ost a discussion entry the program will prompt you by displaying your user name.  Anything you type (including your displayed user name) will be save as your entry.  For example:Discussions(Story) ==>Post an entry: Alan Adams €§type your entry here...€ If you typed "walks into the room", the complete line would read "Alan Adams walks into the room".  For more casual discussions, such as stories, you might enter something like ": Once upon a time...", which would produce "Alan Adams : Once upon a time...".  As you may notice, discussions follow a script-like format.  A typical discussion chain might look like this:Alan Adams walks into the room.Alan Adams shouts "Is anyone there?"Shadow Magic responds "No."Super Glitch laughs then leaves the room.Brass Dragon : This is interesting.Much fun can be generated by this.  (A "War" discussion was available on The Shadow's Realm BBS which would contain entries such as "Doctor X throws a bomb at Frankie", "Frankie says 'That wasn't very nice!!'", and so on...)ôChanging Discussion Namesã€§Changing Discussion Names€ As you move to each discussion you may select "C" and Change the name of that discussion.  Name changes are automatically saved, but you will need to update the DMENU (Discussions Menu) to reflect the names you add.  Only a user with SysOp access can change discussion names.ôBulletins--------------------------- €¥Bulletins€  ---------------------------Users can view text files by using the [B]ulletin option from the Main Menu. This option will show a list of all files available lettered alphabetically starting with "A".  Selecting the appropriate letter will display the file, and pressing [X] will return to the Main Menu.ã€§Controlling Text Output€ Any time a text file is being displayed, the user may pause the file by pressing "P" or Ctrl-S.  To resume press any key.  To stop the listing, press "S", Ctrl-K, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-X, or ESCape.(See also "€§Adding/Removing Bulletins€ " under "€¥SysOp Utilities€ ")ôFile Transfers------------------------- €¥File Transfers€  ------------------------Shadow BBS provides an easy-to-use file transfer system which allows users to send and receive files to the system using either Xmodem or Xmodem-1K (sometimes incorrectly called Ymodem).The [F]ile Transfers command from the Main Menu allows you to [U]pload, [D]ownload, or [Q]uit to the Main Menu.ôUploading a Fileã€§Upload€ The system will ask for a filename.  This can be any valid Disk Basic file name (FILENAME.EXT).  The program will make sure the file doesn't already exist on the disk then prompt the user for the transfer protocol desired.  (The program defaults to the one currently set by the user, but will allow this to be altered.)  After this, the BBS is ready to receive the file and save it to disk.  If the transfer is aborted, any partial data will be deleted from the disk.ôDownloading a Fileã€§Download€ This option will display a menu of files available (similar to the Bulletin menu).  Choose the letter belonging to the desired file then the system will ask for the protocol to use then information on the file (length and estimated time of transfer) will be displayed and the transfer will begin.€¥Note:€   During file transfers a "window" will appear on your screen displaying the status of the transfer.  If you are using 40 columns you will not be able to adequately view this window, but the transfers will still work.ôAutoMessage-------------------------- €¥AutoMessage€  --------------------------To change the AutoMessage which is shown to each user during logon, select the [A]utoMessage option from the Main Menu.  The current automessage will be shown and you will be asked if you wish to change it.  If you select "Y"es you can enter a new message.  When finished entering the message, type the word "END" on a blank line to save it.ôGraphics Support----------------------- €¥Graphics Support€  ------------------------Shadow BBS will indirectly support graphics protocols in the text files and messages.  Currently ANSI is the only protocol viewable on the SysOp's screen.  (If you are using an 80 column monitor, all ANSI codes will be correctly displayed.)  None of the system prompts may contain graphics codes and no filters are used to remove any codes for callers not using ANSI.  (€¥Note:€   A future upgrade is planned to have these functions!)  Therefore, you may wish to setup a special room just for messages with ANSI so non-ANSI users can remove it from their quickscan list.ANSI codes can be placed in text files (by using an ANSI editor, not provided, yet...) but, once again, all users (ANSI and non) will be sent the codes.  We suggest currently limiting ANSI to message areas only.ôUsing ANSI in Messagesã€§Using ANSI in Messages€ Users are free to add any type of escape code sequence to message text.  This is done simply by using the actual ANSI escape sequences.  For example, the ANSI sequence for underline is:<ESC> [ 5 m  - You would add this to your message by pressing               ESCape (Shift-Break) then "[", "5", and "m"               (in lowercase).  Text will blink until it is               turned off with "<ESC> [ m".[A complete list of ANSI codes is included with this manual.]All ANSI codes are supported including cursor movement, insert/delete codes, colors, etc.  While a bit more difficult, this offers almost unlimited flexibility.  (€¥Note:€   A future upgrade will add the ability for users to add color/attribute codes to messages easier.  This is only the beginning!)ã€§Other Protocols€ You may have noticed the system allows the selection of other graphics protocols such as VT-52, VT-100, Vidtex, and Atascii.  Assuming the user has a terminal program capable of generating these codes, they may be inserted in any message text and will correctly display to users with terminal programs supporting them.  However, only ANSI codes are viewable from the SysOp's side.  You may consider setting up special rooms for these other graphics codes as well.  (€¥Note:€   Future upgrades may be able to allow "generic" codes in messages that will be correctly translated to the desired protocol.  These settings are included in this version for compatibility with future releases.)ôSurveys---------------------------- €¥Surveys€  ----------------------------Personalized user-surveys are available on Shadow BBS via the [T]ake a Survey option from the Main Menu.  This section will list a series of multiple-choice questions and allow the user to choose an answer.  The results of previous votes are also displayed.  A typical question may look as follows:Question # 1What do you use your computer for the most?[1]  (  2) Programming[2]  (  7) Games[3]  ( 10) OS-9[4]  ( 24) Telecommunications[5]  (  5) ApplicationsChoice: €§enter your choice here€ The number in parenthesis is how many votes that choice has received.  Shadow BBS allows each user to answer each question only €àonce€`.  If the user tries to take it again he/she will be shown the questions and results, but will not be allowed to answer.ôSetting up a Surveyã€§Setting up a Survey€ At any time while taking a survey, select "+" and you will be asked if you want to create a new one.  If you do, you will be allowed to enter up to 32 questions with up to 8 multiple-choice answers for each.  (€¥Note:€   There is a maximum length of about 250 characters for all of text for each question and it's answers.)  When done all userlog pointers will be reset (so users can take the new survey) and you will be returned to the Main Menu.  Only a user with SysOp access can create a new survey.ôChat Mode--------------------------- €¥Chat Mode€  ---------------------------While online, a user may attempt to call you for a two-way keyboard chat.  Selecting the [C]hat option from the Main Menu will alert you with a series of tones from your monitor speaker, or, if your monitor is off, a relay inside your computer will "click" to let you know a user wishes to chat with you.  The status screen will show that the user has paged.If you wish to chat with the user, press F2.  (You may also forcefully enter Chat Mode with the user by pressing F2 at nearly any time while online.)If you wish to be a bit more graceful when you want to Chat with the user, press ALT-C and a message stating "Sysop requests chat" will be shown to the user.  This allows the user to page you when he/she is ready to chat.Once in Chat Mode, you will be able to type messages back and  forth.  To exit Chat Mode and return the user to the BBS, press ALT-F2.ôLogging Off------------------------- €¥Logging Off€  --------------------------Shadow BBS will automatically reset if a user hangs up or is disconnected while online.  However, it is customary BBS etiquette to logoff properly.  Choose [G]oodbye from the Main Menu and you will be asked if you would like to leave a message to the next caller.  If so, select "Y"es then enter the message just like entering an AutoMessage (See "€¥AutoMessage€ ").  If no message is desired selecting "N"o will display the GOODBYE text file then disconnect the user.  Pressing "A" will abort back to the Main Menu.ôCaller Log------------------------- €¥Caller Log€  --------------------------The [L]ist Recent Callers option from the Main Menu will display a 40 column listing of the last 20 callers to the BBS, their baud rate, and time they called.ôUser Profiles------------------------ €¥User Profiles€  -------------------------The [U]ser Information option serves two purposes.  First, it will display a listing of all the users in the system.  It also allows you to enter the complete name or user number of another user and view any uncensored information in their profile.  Pressing "X" returns to the Main Menu.€¥Note:€   The SysOp is shown ALL information, censored and uncensored.ôBorderlines-------------------------- €¥Borderlines€  --------------------------The [W]rite a Borderline command allows the user to "L"ist all the one-line messages (that are displayed randomly before the Main Menu prompt), "A"dd a line of their own, or e"X"it back to the Main Menu.ôUser Statistics----------------------- €¥User Statistics€  ------------------------The [Y]our Stats command will show information about the current user.  Several settings can also be changed including (G)raphics Protocol, (F)ile Transfer Protocol, Screen (W)idth, Auto-(M)ail Check, Auto-(Q)uickscan, (S)creen Codes, and (P)age Pause.  Pressing the appropriate letter will prompt the user for new settings.(See also "€§Editing the Userlog€ " in "€¥SysOp Utilities€ ")ôSysOp Utilities------------------------ €¥SysOp Utilities€  ------------------------Several quick and easy ways to maintain system files from within the BBS are available.ôEditing the Userlogã€§Editing the Userlog€ The SysOp has the ability to change the status of any user.  You may wish to do this to give a user higher access or to delete or lower the access of a troublesome caller.  All userlog changes are done by logging on as the SysOp and selecting the "[Y]our Stats" command from the Main Menu.You will see your information displayed like this:€àU€`ser number         : 1€àH€`angle              : System Operator(C)hange Password   : MASTER QPSecurity €àL€`evel      : 255€àT€`ime limit          : 60Number of calls     : 42Uploads             : 0Downloads           : 0(G)raphics Protocol : ANSI(F)ile Xfer Protocol: X-Modem CRCScreen (W)idth      : 80 columnsAuto-(M)ail Check   : YesAuto-(Q)uickscan    : NoClear (S)creen Codes: Yes(P)age Pause        : Yes(The options in parenthesis are the normal options any user can change.  The underlined options are those available only to the SysOp.)To begin you must first know the user number of the person you wish to edit. Select "U" and you will see the "User:" prompt appear.  Here you can type the number of the user you wish to "become".  After this the stats for that user will then be displayed.  You may now make the following changes to that user:€àH€`andle       - Allows you to change their name.€àL€`evel        - Allows you to change their access level.  (A               user with level 255 access has SysOp abilities.               Changing the level to 0 deletes that user.)€àT€`ime limit   - Allows you to change their time limit.(C)hange Password also allows the SysOp to change the users' password to €àanything€` desired (up to 12 characters) and bypass the automatic two random letters at the end of the password.  (If a user tries to change his/her password, up to 9 letters will be accepted then two random letters will once again be added to it.)Make any changes you wish then €àbe sure to become yourself again by going back to your user number€`.  Changes are automatically updated in the userlog.ôAdding/Removing Room Accessã€§Adding/Removing Room Access€ While you are temporarily another user (as described above) you may alter which rooms that user has access to.  Simply go to the Main Menu prompt and [J]ump or move to the room you wish to give or remove access.  Pressing the backslash "\" (generated by Shift-Clear) will toggle whether or not the user has access to that room.ôEditing Room Namesã€§Editing the Room Names€ The system comes with default room names.  You should change them or add new ones (up to the maximum number you allowed when you setup the BBS).  This is done by using the "[J]ump to Room" option from the Main Menu.The normal prompt will appear asking you to press Enter to list rooms, "X" to exit, or to enter the name of the room you wish to Jump to.  If you want to add a new room (or change the name of an existing one), select "+" and you will see something like this:<Enter> to list rooms, 'X' to exit.Enter room to jump to: +                   - €§Select "+" here€ Change room number: 6                      - €§Enter room number€ Old name: Room 1                             €§to change€ New name: CoCo Messages                    - €§Type new name€ The new (or renamed) room will now be added and ready for messages.  If you want to delete a room, select "-".  The program will ask you "Empty room number:" and then you may type that number and it will be "emptied".ôAdding/Removing Bulletinsã€§Adding/Removing Bulletins€ The SysOp has total control of the text files listed in the "[B]ulletins" section.  To add a text file to the menu select "+" and you will be asked for the "Name to appear on menu".  This is the menu entry, such as "CoCo Club Meeting" or "System Bulletins".  Enter this then you will be prompted for "Filename to access".  This is the actual text file on the disk.  This must be a valid filename such as "COCOMEET.TXT" or "SYSBULL.TXT".To remove a bulletin entry select "-" from the bulletins menu and you will be prompted to "Delete which entry".  Press the letter of the file you wish to remove.  The system will ask you to "Confirm" your choice and then the file will be deleted from the menu.  (The text file will remain on this disk.)ôAdding/Removing Filesã€§Adding/Removing Files€ Files available for download are added/deleted in exactly the same way that bulletins are.  (See "€§Adding/Removing Bulletins€ " above.)  If you wish to add a file for users to download, just copy that file to the drive you specified for files during setup then add it to the File Transfer menu.ôSystem Maintenance---------------------- €¥System Maintenance€  -----------------------Shadow BBS should be totally self-maintaining.  As the SysOp, it is up to you to validate new users, adjust access of current users, delete "bad" users or messages, and monitor your file transfer drive for uploads.  The message base will grow to the maximum size you specified and then automatically "wrap" around removing the oldest messages.  You may also wish to update the system news file occasionally and correct the time if the clock gets off, but that's about it!ôText Files--------------------------- €¥Text Files€  --------------------------Several important text files will be displayed to the user while online.  These can be created by any word processor.  The files you may wish to alter in order to customize the appearance of your BBS are listed below:GREET   .TXT - Displayed to the user after connection.  It               should contain some kind of information about               the BBS name, etc.BULLETIN.TXT - The system news file which is displayed to               all callers (if they haven't read it yet).GOODBYE .TXT - File displayed to users after [G]oodbye.NEWUSER1.TXT - General information for new users.  This is               displayed after someone logs on as new.  This               should contain any special rules, interests,               or policies about your system.NEWUSER2.TXT - This file is displayed before the profile               questions are asked.OTHERBBS.TXT - A listing of other bulletin board systems.ROOMS   .TXT - The list of all room names and topics.INFO    .TXT - Contains information about your computer setup.MENU 40 .TXT - The 40 column Main Menu.MENU 80 .TXT - The 80 column Main Menu.DMENU   .TXT - The Discussions menu.SMENU   .TXT - The SysOp menu.€¥Note:€   Some word processors do not always generate the "End of File" marker in text files and may not work!ã€§Automatic Text Formatting€ The BBS handles text file formatting column callers.  It will automatically take longer lines then break them down to either 40 or 80 characters per line.  Therefore, the text-only files you create should all be formatted to 80 columns or more.  (It is best to break each file into "paragraphs" of up to 250 characters.  This will produce the best word-wrap during output.)The reason 80 column lines are not recommended is best demonstrated by this example:€§This is the line that I want to automatically be word-wrapped for forty-columns.€ Since the screen would wrap at the word closest to character 40, the output would look like this:€§This is the line that I want toautomatically be word-wrapped forforty-columns.€ Notice that the last line has an "orphaned" word since it would not evenly fit on the second line.  If you have a long paragraph of 80 character lines you may encounter orphaned words every so often.  This is not actually a problem but you should be aware of it.  (€¥Note:€   Similar things can happen in the message base.)Do €ànot€` exceed the 250 character limit for text!  Anything beyond that will be ignored by the program!ôFuture Enhancements---------------------- €¥Future Enhancements€  ----------------------Shadow BBS will probably never be "complete" or "perfect" as enhancements are always being added.  Several major upgrades are currently being worked on including more ANSI control and overall speed increases.  (Large portions of the system are currently being rewritten in machine language.)If you have any ideas, suggestions, or bug reports please contact us either by mail, voice, or BBS.  Your comments will also affect what goes into future upgrades!ôUpgrades--------------------------- €¥Upgrades€  ----------------------------Product upgrades and bug fixes will be available for downloading on the support BBS.  You may want to call from time to time to check for minor updates.When major updates are completed, update disks will be available to registered owners.  It is very important to completely fill out and return the Software Registration Form that came with this package or you may not be eligible for these upgrades.If you encounter any bug or problem with the software simply contact us and a solution will be found as soon as possible.ôAcknowledgements----------------------- €¥Acknowledgements€  -----------------------ã€§A Few Words From the Author...€ No program of this scope can possibly be created by one person, no matter how talented, and Shadow BBS is certainly no exception.   I owe an imeasurable depth of gratitude to my partner, Allen Huffman, who first taught me to use my little CoCo and without whom this BBS could never have been even remotely possible.  He has spent literally thousands of hours helping me in my programming, being there to bounce ideas off of, and being a great friend besides.  Very sincere thanks go also to Ken Johnston, who supplied me with many of the M/L routines neccessary for this BBS to function, including the ANSI driver, the serial and RS232 drivers, and the X-Modem routine.  Ken has been very cooperative and helpful above and beyond what I had any right to expect or hope.  Thank you also to Steve Bjork, who has allowed me to use his DFIX routine to speed up disk access for the BBS, and who has been quite openly informative about the workings of the CoCo.I appreciate the help of all those who have helped me in my quest for a low-hardware BBS that still has power, speed and flair, and those mentioned above are far from a complete list.  Thank you also to all of the loyal Shadow's Realm callers who patiently stood by my BBS even in its worst moments (and believe me, there were some bad ones), and to everybody else who has helped me in one way or another to get this thing off the ground.ôDisclaimer-------------------------- €¥Disclaimer€  ---------------------------This program is sold on an "as-is" basic.
