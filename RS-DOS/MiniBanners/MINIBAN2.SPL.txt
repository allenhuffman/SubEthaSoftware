  ------------------------- Introduction --------------------------  Thank You for helping support the  future  of the CoCo!  You have  just  purchased  a  program   which   we   hope  will  bring  new  functionality from your printer.  MiniBanners will  allow  you  to  print  single- or multiple-line  banners to  any  printer,  including  daisy  wheel  printers, and  "non-standard" printers such as the  TP-10.  (Yes, there is a use  for that little printer!)  Also included  with  MiniBanners  is  a  collection  of  over  30  character styles, known  as  "fonts"  to  use  for  your banners.  These included everything from  gothic,  bold, computer printing,  italics, inverse, etc.  [Note:  There are  two  versions  of  MiniBanners.   One for Disk  Basic (refered to as the RS-Dos  version) and one for OS-9.  This  manual will cover both versions.  Any special command differences  between versions will be noted.]  ---------------------- Loading Instructions ---------------------  Before using MiniBanners, we recommend  you make a Backup of your  master disk and use that.  Refer to your Disk Basic or OS9 manual  if you are unsure on how to do this, or call our support line.                           RS-Dos Version  To load the program, insert the MiniBanners disk into Drive 0 and  type:                           LOADM"MINIBAN"  The program will quickly  load  and  the "OK" prompt will return.  To run MiniBanners, type:                                EXEC  [Note:  In the RS-Dos version,  if  you  hold  down the Enter key  after typing 'EXEC' the program will  start up using an 80 column  screen.]  Proceed to "Loading Instructions Continued".                            OS9 Version  The OS9 version of  MiniBanners  requires  you to have a bootable  OS9 diskette with  the  "/P"  printer  driver  and "/W" (non-VDG)  screen.  MiniBanners also requires access  to  RUNB and GFX2 from  your OS9 System/Config Disk.  (Many  users  choose to merge these  modules together into one  file.   If  you have done that, simply  load the merged module then swap to the MiniBanners disk and type  "MINIBAN".)                            Page 1 of 7  A special installation program,  called "INSTALL.MB", is included  to help you get MiniBanners09 up and running as soon as possible.  Boot OS9 from your  system  disk  then  swap to the MiniBanners09  disk and type "INSTALL.MB".  The  program will prompt you for all  necessary actions and will also  install  MiniBanners09 to a hard  drive.  Once installed, simply boot OS9 and type:       OS9: LOAD RUNB  Next, insert the MiniBanners09 disk and type:       OS9: CHD /D0; CHX /D0/CMDS  And finally, to run the program from a non-VDG window type:       OS9: MINIBAN  If you are on a 32  column  VDG screen or just want MiniBanners09  to create it's own window to run in, type:       OS9: MINIBAN <>>>/W&  (You will then need to press  the  [CLEAR] key until you find the  screen MiniBanners09 is running on.)  [NOTE:  MiniBanners09 will NOT run from a VDG screen!]  Hard drive users  who  have  installed  MINIBAN  into  their CMDS  directory (where the merged RUNB  file  should reside) and have a  MINIBAN directory (where the  font  files  reside) need only type  "CHD /H0/MINIBAN" then  "MINIBAN"  (or  "MINIBAN <>>>/W&") to run  the program.  A sample  "do"  (batch)  file  is included for hard  drive users entitled "doban".  While these instructions  assume  you  are  using  a single drive  setup  or  have  a  hard  drive,  many  other  setup  options are  available.  As long  as  your  execution directory contains RUNB,  GFX2, and MINIBAN, and your  working  directory is where the font  files are, MiniBanners09 should  run  fine.   (RUNB  and GFX2 can  also be merged with MINIBAN to make it a stand-alone program!)  NOTE:  Make sure you  have  set  your  working directory (CHD) to  point to wherever the  font  and  config files are located before  running or the program will not be able to operate.                   Loading Instructions Continued  MiniBanners will then load  and  you  will see the startup screen  with a version, serial  number,  and  copyright notice.  You will  then be prompted whether or not  you wish to load a configuration  saved on disk.  At this time  press  "N" (for No) and the default  parameters will be used.  You will then be at the Main Menu.  Note:  For those of you  who  want  to get the program running as  soon as possible, please consult the section called "Quick Start"  at the end of this manual for complete step-by-step instructions.                            Page 2 of 7  ------------------------- The Main Menu -------------------------                  Changing Your Working Drive/Path                           RS-Dos Version  [D]rive            - At the top of the screen it shows which                       drive the program is currently set to work                       with.  If you wish to change this, press "D"                       then enter the new drive number.                            OS9 Version  [P]ath             - At the top of the screen is shows which                       drive/directory the program is currently                       set towork with.  To change this, press "P"                       then enter the complete path list.  (ie,                       "/D1", "/H0/MINIBAN", etc.)                         Printing a Banner  Note:  Make sure you have  set  the  baud  rate for your printer!  See "Configuration" below,  or  the  "Quick  Start" section.  OS9  users must have /P properly XMODEd with correct settings.  [1] Print a Banner - Selecting this option takes you to a                       different screen where you will be prompted                       for the following information:      Printer Width [ 80] :  - Enter the carriage width of your                               printer.  Most common printers are                               able to print 80 characters across,                               but MiniBanners supports anything                               from 32 to 132.  Pressing Enter will                               use the default value displayed in                               the [brackets].      Font Width    [  1] :  - Enter the width you wish the banner                               letters to be printed.  A width of 1                               is normal for multiple line banners,                               but a thicker width such as 3 may be                               more desireable for larger text.      Line Spacing  [  0] :  - Enter the number of spaces to skip                               between printed lines.  While                               normally 0, you may want to change                               this for multiple line banners.      Ptr Character [219] :  - Enter the ASCII value of the                               character you want your banner                               letters to be made from.  This may                               be any value from 32 to 255.  On a                               printer in IBM mode, 219 produces a                               block character.  In Tandy mode, you                               may want to try 239.  If you want a                               banner printed with *'s try 42.                            Page 3 of 7  After typing in any changes (or just pressing Enter to accept the  default values), you are now ready  to  type in you text.  At the  ">" prompt, type in your first line and press Enter.  The program  will prompt you for:      Height [10] Max  :     - The number in brackets is the                               maximum height your banner may be                               based on the width of the printer.                               You may press Enter to accept this                               value and generate one large banner,                               or type in a smaller value to create                               a banner with multiple lines.  If                               you choose a smaller number, the                               line you typed is displayed in the                               lower portion of the screen (as well                               as it's height) and you are asked to                               enter the next line, and so on,                               until you quit by pressing Enter at                               the ">" prompt, or the program runs                               out of space.  If  you  have  entered  a  line  shorter  than  the  max.  height  available, the program will ask if  you  wish to "Center from Top  to Bottom?"  Select "Y"es or "N"o.  (If you answer No, the banner  will be printer resting on the bottom of the page.)  Next you will be asked if everything is okay.  If it is, and your  printer is ready to print, press  "Y".  The program will check to  see if your  printer  is  on-line  (ready)  for  printing.  If it  ins't, a message will be  displayed  allowing  you to turn on the  printer or "X"it.  During printing,  you  may press "X" to abort.  The OS9 version uses BREAK to stop printing and restart.  After the banner has been  printed,  you  will return to the Main  Menu.                      Choosing Different Fonts  [2] Select Font    - This option will allow you to select a                       different font (character style) for the                       banner.  The current font is shown beside                       the command.  The program will go to a  new  screen  and ask you to type in the  name of the font you  want  to  load.   If  you are unsure of the  name, you may type "D" for Directory and the program will display  a listing of all font files on  the current disk.  (At the end of  each screenful the  program  will  pause  and  ask  you to "Press  [ENTER] for More, [X] to Stop".  If you would like to see what the fonts look like, select "P" for  Preview and the screen will show  each font on the current drive.  When the screen fills, you  may  press  Enter for more, or "X" to  stop.   (Note:   You  will  not   see   any  prompts  for  this.)  Currently, the OS9 version does not support Preview.                            Page 4 of 7                           Configuration  [3] Configuration  - This option allows you to set printer baud                       rate, carriage width, font size and default                       font.  This options may be saved to disk in                       a file named MINIBAN.CFG and then loaded                       upon startup.      [E]dit - This option will allow you to change the values               currently displayed.  You will be prompted to enter               new values for each item or press Enter to not               change.               Note that the baud rate display shows two values.               The first is the actual baud rate and the second is               the actual value (POKE 150,xx).  Since MiniBanners               runs in the double speed mode, this value will               actually be for the baud that is half of what is               listed.  (OS9 version does not have baud settings.)      [L]oad - This option will load the default values stored in               the MINIBAN.CFG file (if present) from the current               drive/path.      [S]ave - This will save the current parameters to a file               called MINIBAN.CFG.      [X]it  - Exits the Configuration screen and returns to the               main menu.                       Changing Screen Widths  [W] Toggle 40/80  - This will switch the program between a 40                      column screen and an 80 column screen.                        Exiting the Program  [X]it to Basic    - This will end MiniBanners and return you to                      Basic/OS9.  You will be prompted as to                      whether or not you really want to exit.                            Page 5 of 7  -------------------------- Quick Start --------------------------                  For Those Who Just Can't Wait...  The RS-Dos version comes setup for  a  printer in IBM mode hooked  up at 2400 baud.  Unless you just happen to have a printer in IBM  mode hooked up at 2400 baud  you will have to first customize the  program for your setup.  The  OS9  version uses whatever defaults  your OS9 boot disk has.  First, go to the Configuration menu by pressing "3".  You will be  shown all of the  current  settings.   Select "E" (for Edit) then  you can enter the specific information about your printer.  (Note:  At each  prompt,  pressing  Enter  will  use  the default  values displayed.)  Printer Width - This is how many characters your printer can       print per line.  Usually 80, but 132 column wide carriage       printers or even 32 column printers (such as the TP-10) are       supported.  Printer Baud - This is the baud rate that your printer is set to.       The number beside it is the actual value (POKE 150,xx) used       by Basic for the baud half of what you are using.  (This is       because MiniBanners runs in the double speed mode.)  The OS9       version does not support changing printer baud.  Font Width - This will be the thickness of the letters.  For now       type "3".  Line Spacing - This is how many lines are skipped between lines       of text on a multiple-line banner.  For now, leave it at 0.  Banner Character - This is what character your printer uses to       make the letters.  On a printer in IBM mode, 219 creates       a filled in block.  In Tandy mode, 239 is a similar block.       Other values, such as 42 (for a "*" character) may also be       used.  Default Font - This is the name of the Font (character style)       that the program will attempt to load on startup.  For now,       skip this by just pressing Enter.  With configuration done, you may proceed with "Printing a Banner"  from The Main Menu.  Have fun!                            Page 6 of 7  -------------------- A Few Words About Fonts --------------------  Some really clever users out there may notice that the fonts this  program uses  are  standard  HPRINT  character  sets.   The fonts  included are in the public  domain  and  may  be used by your own  programs.  (Simply LOADM"FONTNAME.FNT"  then  anything you HPRINT  to one of the HSCREENs will be that font.)  Also, if you find any  alternative HPRINT fonts you  can  copy  them  to the MiniBanners  disk with the extension of .FNT and use them to make banners.  If you have any  HPRINT  fonts  you  have  created, please let us  know.  We may be interested!  ---------------------- Future Enhancements ----------------------  MiniBanners is undergoing changes  and improvements.  If you have  any suggestions on  what  you  would  like  to  see added, please  contact us!  ------------------------- Special Notes -------------------------  While  incredibly  rare  <smile>,   occasional  bugs  creep  into  programs.  If any error is encountered a screen will be displayed  identifying the bug and  what  line  it was encountered.  If this  happens and you are  reasonable  sure  it isn't something on your  end, such as a  Disk  Full  or  I/O  error,  make  a note of this  problem and contact us so we may exterminate.  Thank you for supporting  Sub-Etha  Software  and  our efforts to  help support the future of the Color Computer!  --------------------------- Disclaimer --------------------------  (What decent piece  of  software  would  complete  without one of  these?)  This program is sold on  an  "as-is" basis.
