                    A New Text-Based User Interface for OS-9...


     Multi-Vue was a good attempt at bringing a standardized point and click
  windowing interface to Color  Computer  OS-9.   Unfortunately,  the  stock
  Multi-Vue  was  less than perfect, being slow and containing various bugs.
  GShell+ (a series of shareware patches for Multi-Vue) along  with  various
  contributions  by  the  legendary Kevin Darling "beefed up" Multi-Vue into
  something much more useable.
     Unfortunately,  even  with  these  enhancements  Multi-Vue  never quite
  became a commonly used interface.  First, not  everyone  owned  it  (after
  all,  you  had to have the package and WindInt in your bootfile before you
  could run a Multi-Vue program) and of those that did, many still  did  not
  use it.  So...the proposed standard never fully evolved.
     Multi-Vue is still our only source for a graphical standard among Color
  Computer   OS-9   users.    Sadly,   due   to  difficulty  in  programming
  applications, the lack of full  standards,  and  the  overall  lack  of  a
  userbase,  it was felt that another "standard" was needed.  Welcome to the
  new world of EthaWin, a point-and-click menu interface for OS-9.


  THE BEGINNING

     To understand WHY another "standard" is being proposed, some background
  should  be  know.  Back in 1990, Joel Mathew Hegberg created a CoCo RS-DOS
  program (CheckBook+) that worked on a graphical screen using mouse control
  and  pull  down  menus.   The next year, the decision was made to port the
  program to OS-9, yet without requiring Multi-Vue  it  was  impractical  to
  write a full graphical interface for the program.
     Joel decided to create a similar interface  based  on  a  TEXT  screen.
  Using  a  text-cursor,  he was able to have pop-up dialog boxes, pull down
  menus, and all those things normally associated with graphical interfaces.
  Best  of  all,  it worked quite nicely.  Sadly, due to the effort it takes
  to create an interface like this from the ground  up  it  never  became  a
  "normal" thing for OS-9 programs.
     Also around this time, a utility called CCTOOLS (from a  Canadian  CoCo
  Club I believe) was circulating using a text-based interface complete with
  "hot-key" support.  At least someone else out  there  was  thinking  about
  this.   But, other than these two programs, it seems like the thought of a
  text-based interface was not going to become commonplace...

  WHAT IS ETHAWIN?

     EthaWin  is  an  attempt  to  create  an  easy-to-use,  easy-to-program
  windowing  interface  for  OS-9.   With  enough  routines  in place, all a
  programmer would have to do is define the menus and then make a few  calls
  to  the  routines to see what the use selected.  No linked lists, no fancy
  setup, just easy "run and go"  operating.   From  the  user's  standpoint,
  EthaWin offers FULL mouse support as well as COMPLETE keyboard support via
  "hot-keys" to access menus.
     For instance, you might click on the "FILE" menu with a mouse, or press
  ALT-F to pull down  the  menu.   Each  menu  item  also  has  a  "hot-key"
  (underlined)  which  can  be  pressed  to  instantly  select that command.
  Basically, EthaWin is modeled after the look and feel  of  Tandy  Deskmate
  (tm) on the PCs and Microsoft Windows (tm).

  WHAT IS ETHADEMO?

     EthaDemo  is  a  simple demonstration of EthaWin.  It doesn't really do
  anything, BUT you can see (for the most part) how the menus operate.  Here
  are some things to observe:

     o Mouse Support
        Move  the  text-cursor  over  the  menu name to pull down and click.
  Once the menu is displayed move up or down to choose the option you desire
  then  click to select it.  If an option is currently unselectable, it will
  appear in a different color and will not be choosable.  Some  options  may
  be  "tagged"  and  have a small symbol to the left of the name.  Selecting
  these options will toggle them on or off.  (Select options under the  TEXT
  menu  to  see  how  this works.)  To abort a menu, move all the way to the
  bottom of the menu (below the last item) and click.
     o Keyboard Support
        The underlined letter of the menus is what you would select to  pull
  it  down.   For  instance, to pull down the FILE menu press "ALT-F".  Once
  the menu is displayed, use the up/down arrow keys to choose a  menu  item.
  Pressing  ENTER  will select it, or you can press BREAK to abort the menu.
  You may also use the left/right arrows to move from one menu to the  next.
     
     To exit the demo, select QUIT from  the  FILE  menu.   Selecting  ABOUT
  (Alt-A) or HELP (Alt-F) bring up simple dialog boxes.

  CONFIGURING ETHAWIN PROGRAMS

     Located  in  a  /DD/SYS/ETHAWIN  directory  should reside a file called
  "ethawin.cfg".  This file has  simple  text  lines  that  control  various
  aspects  of the EthaWin interface including colors, mouse support, and how
  the menus operate.  More options  will  be  added  to  this  file  as  the
  interface  evolves,  but for now the basic features are in place.  Most of
  the entries should be fairly easy to understand.

  SOFTWARE BASE

     An EthaWin for the MM/1 will also be created (and possibly one to  work
  with TermCap on any OSK machine).  The MM/1 version will look MUCH fancier
  and work using the MM/1 mouse control (with nifty  3-D  metallic  windows,
  etc.).   What  is  good  about  this  is that if someone writes an EthaWin
  program for the CoCo, it can easily (?) be ported to run on the MM/1.
     EthaWin  is  written  in  'C',  though  it might be possible to make it
  callable from BASIC09 or assembly language.  This has yet to be discussed.

  WILL IT BECOME A 'STANDARD'?

     We think it could, and here is why.  Developers will be able to get the
  full  EthaWin  development  system  *FREE*.  (We might charge for disk and
  manual expenses if necessary.)  They will be free to write programs  under
  the  interface for shareware release.  The only "catch" is as follows:  If
  a program is written for commercial release, Sub-Etha  would  like  to  be
  able to distribute it as well.
     That's it!  No royalties, startup costs, or anything.  Just  write  and
  get  some good software out there.  Sub-Etha will end up with a library of
  EthaWin products to market (hopefully) which, of course, we pay the author
  royalties on...and we don't even ask "exclusive" rights to these programs!
  There really is no "gotcha" to this proposal!

  WHAT'S NEXT?

     The interface works now, but there are many more things to add  to  the
  library.   We  are looking for qualified 'C' programmers who might want to
  work on this project.  It's a non-paying job (unless, of course, you write
  something that uses the interface and sell it).  Any takers?
