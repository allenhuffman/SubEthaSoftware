IntroductionCheckBook+ is the result of months of work to make a uniquecheckbook balancing program for the Color Computer 3.  In theprogram, I have put all the basic features you would expect to findin any checkbook balancing program.  If I had stopped there, Imight as well have called it "CheckBook!"  (Boring!)  However, the'+' sign translates into "plus a whole lot more!"  CheckBook+ hascountless features which have never before been done on any othercheckbook balancing program.  It's features like the easy point-and-click interface, the pull down menus, the pop-up calculator withrunning total, the ability to graph by the month or the year usingbar-, line-, or pi-graphs, the various sorting operations, etc...which make CheckBook+ stand out from the competition!This manual has lots of information in it.  Although the program isdesigned to be very easy to use (thanks to it's point-and-clickpull-down-menu design), you really should read this manualcompletely through before doing anything serious with it.  (Inother words... after you've loaded it up for the first time andplayed around with it before reading this!)  By taking the time toread through this manual, you will get the most out of yourCheckBook+ purchase.If you have any comments, questions, or suggestions, please feelfree to contact Sub-Etha Software for assistance and anything majorwill be passed along to me.  Or if you have Delphi, feel free tocontact me there.  My username is JOELHEGBERG.  On GEnie, myelectronic mailbox address is J.HEGBERG.  Thank you for yourpurchase and I hope you enjoy this program as much as I've enjoyedbringing it to the CoCo Community!Sincerely,Joel Mathew Hegberg
