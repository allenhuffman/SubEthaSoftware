10/11/91, Revised 9/15/94

This archive contains a DEMONSTRATION VERSION of MiniBanners09 from
Sub-Etha Software.  This demo will allow you to get the "feel" of how
the program operates and will even print sample banners using the
parameters you specify.  However, no actual banner text is accepted.
 
Copy MBanDemo to your CMDS directory.  You must have RUNB merged with
GFX2 in your CMDS directory also.  Place the font files (.fnt) in a
sub-directory or in the current working directory then, from a non-VDG
screen, type MBANDEMO to execute the demo.  (You may also type
"MBANDEMO <>>>/w&" and the program will create it's own screen to run
in.)
 
The program should be fairly self-explanatory.  Complete demo instructions
will be written shortly.  I wanted to get this demo out as soon as possible
for those who have been wanting to see just how MiniBanners works.  While
not complete, this demo should get you started.
 
Quick Notes:
 
On startup you are asked if you want to load in a saved configuration.
Config contains information on default banner parameters and screen width.
 
1) Print a Banner - Asks you to enter your printer width (32-132 columns),
   font width (thickness of banner letters), line spacing (lines to skip
   between lines on multiple line banners), and printer character (the
   ASCII value of the character to make banners with - 219 on IBM printer
   is a block, 239 on Tandy printer is a similar block).
 
   You are then prompted to the first line of text, followed by the max
   heigth for the line.  If you choose a smaller height you can continue
   to enter lines until no more space is available.  The banner may be
   centered on the page or printed resting on the bottom of the page.
 
   NOTE:  Your actual text will not be printed.  A demo message will be.
 
2) Select a Font - You can see a [D]irectory of FONT files or type in
   the name of the font you want to load.
 
3) Configuration - Select defaults (to be loaded on startup).  You must
   [S]ave the config file to create it.
 
W) Toggle 40/80 - Creates either 40 or 80 column screen.
 
X) Exit to OS9 - Quit and gives ordering instructions!
 
Okay, that's it for a quick description.  Watch for a more up-to-date
archive coming soon.  I may be reached on GEnie as "COCO-SYSOP" or on the
internet as "coco-sysop@genie.geis.com".  Have fun and get back to me with
any comments!
